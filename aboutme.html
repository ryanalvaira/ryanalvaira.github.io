					<p class="aboutme-content text-justify">Hi, I'm Narciso Alvaira Jr. but you can call me "Ryan". I'm a passionate coder and a front - end developer. Coding is my passion. I love coding more than anything that I can do to my computer. I am a self-taught developer that started coding since I entered college and I realized that it is my passion and I want to pursue it. As of now, I'm free to take freelance projects, so if you need a website just beep me up. Being a front - end developer is not an easy job but I believed that if you're passionate on what you're doing, it will not be hard for you to do it.</p>

					<p class="aboutme-content2 text-justify">I'm a 21 years old fresh graduate student from ACLC Batangas currently looking for an office based job where i can use my skills and enhance it as well. I really love creating and designing beautiful websites because it gives me a boxs of happiness and satisfaction that no one else can give when i'm alone. I want to be a full stack developer soon. And with the help of my curiousity on how technology works, I believed that sooner or later i will be the man with a title of full stack web developer.</p>
					<h1 class="paragraph-heading">Great experiences...</h1>
					<p class="aboutme-content2 text-justify">On my college days, I became the leader on our thesis study for a start-up restaurant company. We created a fully responsive website including all the informations that the customer would like to know. Because of that I learn how to work with a team and how to handle them as well. Since it was my first time on handling a team it becomes hard for me to do it right. But later on, I realized it is a chance not everyone can have. So i take it as a challenge because i really like challenges. It gives me the drive to develop myself more. I'm not afraid of failure because i believe that all of us can have a successful career. It just depends on you if you give up on striving for your goals or continuous it until you got it. </p>
